# geschool-thing
silly project in my free time
basically modified most of the thing

what it does to the app : 
- allow screenshots
- disabling the logs when exiting the app or unpinning the app while in a ongoing exam
- many other stuff but not worth mentioning
- can freely exit the app without the exam being locked out 

:)
