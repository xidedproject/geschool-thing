# geschool-thing
silly project in my free time
basically modified the MainActivity.smali ( current version 1.17 ) 

what it does to the app : 
- allow screenshots
- disabling the logs when exiting the app or unpinning the app while in a ongoing exam
- many other stuff but not worth mentioning
- can freely exit the app without the exam being locked out ( possible on version 1.14 )

  how to apply :
  1. download geschool from apkpure
  2. decompile it
  3. put the MainActivity.smali and AndroidManifest , replace the original one
  4. compile the app and then sign the app
  5. try on phone .

     if you can screenshot on this page , then it works .
